# Ages_prediction_on_MRI_of_brains
In this project I predict ages of patients with Mltiple Sclerosis using their Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans of their brains.
# Data 
the dataset consist of three-dimensional T1-weighted scans. The scans have been preprocessed (bias-field correction, skull stripping, resampling etc.) and are provided in NifTi-1 data format.
The data is given by an array of shape (91x109x91).
